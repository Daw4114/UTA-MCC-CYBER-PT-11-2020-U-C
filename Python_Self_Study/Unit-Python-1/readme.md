## Unit 3: Intro to Python Programming 

By the end of each class, students will be able to:

### Day 1: Learning Objectives

* Explain how and why Python is used in cybersecurity.
* Create and run Python files via the terminal using VS Code.
* Use the `print()` function to print lines to the console.
* Use basic Python elements like variables and operators. 
* Employ the Python `input()` function to retrieve, store, and utilize user inputs. 
* Reference and store collections of data using lists.
* Create and reference data in dictionaries.
* Use `listVariable.append(Value)`, `listVariable.index(Value)`, and `listVariable.remove(Value)` to add, return, and delete values from a list
* Use `len(listVariable)` function to return the length of a list.


### Day 2: Learning Objectives

* Use simple and complex conditionals to create branching paths for programs to execute.
* Build a command-line application using conditionals and user input.
* Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through lists and dictionaries to perform basic operations on collections of data.
* Use the `range` function to loop through a list with defined ranges. 
* Use the `enumerate` function to loop through a list with a built-in counter. 
* Use `key`, `value`, and `item` methods with loops to convert data from dictionaries into lists.

### Day 3: Learning Objectives

* Define and call functions. 
* Create functions to print data from a dictionary.
* Create functions with arguments to make them more modular.
* Create functions with return values.
* Build command-line applications that both return and print out values to the user.
